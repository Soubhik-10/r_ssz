## NOTE

This implementation is relatively _new_ and is not yet _production-ready_. All components have been developed based on a personal interpretation of [EIP-7495](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7916).

We’re currently working on improving the overall structure of the project, with [Issue #27](https://github.com/Soubhik-10/r_ssz/issues/27) being a key milestone. Contributions are highly welcome — whether it’s feedback, ideas, or code.

We would love to add more robust test cases and will love some feedback from the authors if possible.

We’d like to express our gratitude to [_Etan Kissling_](https://github.com/etan-status) and [_Cayman_](https://github.com/wemeetagain), the original authors of the EIP, for their foundational work.
